\title{Perform UMAP and calculate distance-based group statistics}
\usage{
umap5(x, info, do.plot = TRUE, n_components, k = c(1, 2, 5, 10, 20))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A distance matrix or object that can be coerced to one.}

\item{info}{A vector of group labels for each data point.}

\item{do.plot}{Logical; if TRUE, creates a pairs plot of the UMAP result.}

\item{n_components}{Integer; the number of dimensions for UMAP.}

\item{k}{Vector of integers; the number of neighbors to consider for distance calculations.}
}
\value{
A vector of mean distance-based group statistics across multiple UMAP runs.
}
\description{
This function applies UMAP to the input data and calculates distance-based group statistics.
