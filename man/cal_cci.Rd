\title{Calculate Cluster Conservation Index (CCI)}
\usage{
cal_cci(ensemble.out, mev.out, info)
}
\arguments{
\item{ensemble.out}{A list containing the output from the ensemble method, including the ensemble distance matrix.}

\item{mev.out}{A list containing the output from the ADM method, including the diffusion distance matrix.}

\item{info}{A vector or factor containing cluster information for each data point.}
}
\value{
A list containing two elements:
  \item{cci_viz}{A matrix with CCI values for the ensemble method}
  \item{cci_adm}{A matrix with CCI values for the ADM method}
}
\description{
This function calculates the Cluster Conservation Index (CCI) for both the ensemble and ADM methods.
}
\details{
The function calculates CCI for different numbers of neighbors (1, 2, 5, 10, 20) and
for different representations of the data (raw, UMAP, PCA).
